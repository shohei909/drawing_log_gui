	The `globalShortcut` module can register/unregister a global keyboard shortcut with the operating system so that you can customize the operations for various shortcuts.
	
	**Note:** The shortcut is global; it will work even if the app does not have the keyboard focus. You should not use this module until the `ready` event of the app module is emitted.
