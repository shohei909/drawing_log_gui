	### Frameless window
	
	To create a window without chrome, or a transparent window in arbitrary shape, you can use the Frameless Window API.
	
	### Showing window gracefully
	
	When loading a page in the window directly, users may see the page load incrementally, which is not a good experience for a native app. To make the window display without visual flash, there are two solutions for different situations.
	
	### Using `ready-to-show` event
	
	While loading the page, the `ready-to-show` event will be emitted when the renderer process has rendered the page for the first time if the window has not been shown yet. Showing the window after this event will have no visual flash:
	
	```
	const { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')
	let win = new BrowserWindow({ show: false })
	win.once('ready-to-show', () => {
	  win.show()
	})
	```
	
	This event is usually emitted after the `did-finish-load` event, but for pages with many remote resources, it may be emitted before the `did-finish-load` event.
	
	Please note that using this event implies that the renderer will be considered "visible" and paint even though `show` is false.  This event will never fire if you use `paintWhenInitiallyHidden: false`
	
	### Setting `backgroundColor`
	
	For a complex app, the `ready-to-show` event could be emitted too late, making the app feel slow. In this case, it is recommended to show the window immediately, and use a `backgroundColor` close to your app's background:
	
	```
	const { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')
	
	let win = new BrowserWindow({ backgroundColor: '#2e2c29' })
	win.loadURL('https://github.com')
	```
	
	Note that even for apps that use `ready-to-show` event, it is still recommended to set `backgroundColor` to make app feel more native.
	
	### Parent and child windows
	
	By using `parent` option, you can create child windows:
	
	```
	const { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')
	
	let top = new BrowserWindow()
	let child = new BrowserWindow({ parent: top })
	child.show()
	top.show()
	```
	
	The `child` window will always show on top of the `top` window.
	
	### Modal windows
	
	A modal window is a child window that disables parent window, to create a modal window, you have to set both `parent` and `modal` options:
	
	```
	const { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')
	
	let child = new BrowserWindow({ parent: top, modal: true, show: false })
	child.loadURL('https://github.com')
	child.once('ready-to-show', () => {
	  child.show()
	})
	```
	
	### Page visibility
	
	The Page Visibility API works as follows:
	
	* On all platforms, the visibility state tracks whether the window is hidden/minimized or not.
	* Additionally, on macOS, the visibility state also tracks the window occlusion state. If the window is occluded (i.e. fully covered) by another window, the visibility state will be `hidden`. On other platforms, the visibility state will be `hidden` only when the window is minimized or explicitly hidden with `win.hide()`.
	* If a `BrowserWindow` is created with `show: false`, the initial visibility state will be `visible` despite the window actually being hidden.
	* If `backgroundThrottling` is disabled, the visibility state will remain `visible` even if the window is minimized, occluded, or hidden.
	
	It is recommended that you pause expensive operations when the visibility state is `hidden` in order to minimize power consumption.
	
	### Platform notices
	
	* On macOS modal windows will be displayed as sheets attached to the parent window.
	* On macOS the child windows will keep the relative position to parent window when parent window moves, while on Windows and Linux child windows will not move.
	* On Linux the type of modal windows will be changed to `dialog`.
	* On Linux many desktop environments do not support hiding a modal window.

It is recommended to always set the `event.returnValue` explicitly, instead of only returning a value, as the former works more consistently within Electron._
