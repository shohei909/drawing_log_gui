		A `String` property that can be `system`, `light` or `dark`.  It is used to override and supersede the value that Chromium has chosen to use internally.
		
		Setting this property to `system` will remove the override and everything will be reset to the OS default.  By default `themeSource` is `system`.
		
		Settings this property to `dark` will have the following effects:
		
		* `nativeTheme.shouldUseDarkColors` will be `true` when accessed
		* Any UI Electron renders on Linux and Windows including context menus, devtools, etc. will use the dark UI.
		* Any UI the OS renders on macOS including menus, window frames, etc. will use the dark UI.
		* The `prefers-color-scheme` CSS query will match `dark` mode.
		* The `updated` event will be emitted
		
		Settings this property to `light` will have the following effects:
		
		* `nativeTheme.shouldUseDarkColors` will be `false` when accessed
		* Any UI Electron renders on Linux and Windows including context menus, devtools, etc. will use the light UI.
		* Any UI the OS renders on macOS including menus, window frames, etc. will use the light UI.
		* The `prefers-color-scheme` CSS query will match `light` mode.
		* The `updated` event will be emitted
		
		The usage of this property should align with a classic "dark mode" state machine in your application where the user has three options.
		
		* `Follow OS` --> `themeSource = 'system'`
		* `Dark Mode` --> `themeSource = 'dark'`
		* `Light Mode` --> `themeSource = 'light'`
		
		Your application should then always use `shouldUseDarkColors` to determine what CSS to apply.
